# Drop Modal

Drop modals are in-between dropdowns and modals. In fact, on mobile they're indistinguishable from a normal spot-modal.
The key difference however, is that they're tied to a specific context. On desktop views, the modal will open
in-context, meaning that it will attach to the button or input field that opened the modal.

<Canvas
  of={DropModalStories.Default}
  height="400px"
  layout="centered"
/>

## Usage

To use drop-modals, make sure to also add the drop-modal portal to the base of your application HTML:

```
<spot-drop-modal-portal></spot-drop-modal-portal>
```

Even though drop-modals look like they are attached to an element, they're actually rendered in this portal to make sure
they're not cut off my scrolling context or `overflow: visible` rules on parent elements.

<ArgsTable of={SpotDropModalComponent} />
